# simple machine learning project
in this project the co2 emission has predicted by linear regression model and the target(co2 emission) is continuous variable.
r2-score shows how much well the model has predicted the target.
# Understanding the Data
fuel consumption dataset has been downloaded , FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

1-MODELYEAR e.g. 2014

2-MAKE e.g. Acura

3-MODEL e.g. ILX

4-VEHICLE CLASS e.g. SUV

5-ENGINE SIZE e.g. 4.7

6-CYLINDERS e.g 6

7-TRANSMISSION e.g. A6

8-FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km) e.g. 9.9

9-FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km) e.g. 8.9

10-FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km) e.g. 9.2

11-CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) e.g. 182 --> low --> 0
